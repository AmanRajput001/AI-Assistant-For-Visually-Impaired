# AI Powered Virtual Assistant for Visually Impaired

## Project Overview

Visually impaired individuals face unique challenges when using existing Android applications designed for them. Many lack crucial voice interaction features, relying heavily on touch-based interfaces. This project aims to bridge this gap by developing an Android app tailored for the visually impaired community, providing a comprehensive platform with voice control functionality.

## Functionalities

The app will consolidate essential features, focusing on improving accessibility for visually impaired users. Here's a comparison with existing apps:

| Existing Apps       | Speaking Ability | Object Recognition | Text Recognition | Face Recognition | Voice Interaction |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Envision AI           | Yes               | Yes                 | Yes               | Yes               | No               |
| Tap Tap See           | Yes               | No                  | Yes               | No                | No               |
| Lookout               | No                | Yes                 | No                | No                | No               |

In our app, we will aim to incorporate all the functionalities mentioned above, with a particular emphasis on implementing voice control as a crucial feature.

## Key Features

### 1. Voice Interaction

Users can seamlessly navigate the app and interact with its features using intuitive voice commands, creating a hands-free and user-friendly experience.

### 2. Object Recognition

Real-time identification of objects through the smartphone camera, accompanied by audio feedback, enriches the user's understanding of their surroundings.

### 3. Text Recognition

Effortlessly extracts text from images and documents, transforming it into spoken audio for enhanced accessibility and user engagement.

### 4. Face Recognition

Utilizes advanced facial recognition technology to identify familiar faces captured by the camera, announcing their names to the user, fostering a more personalized and socially engaging experience.


## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to empower visually impaired individuals by providing a simple and user-friendly interface. The incorporation of voice control and a smart chatbot aims to facilitate communication for visually impaired users. This initiative strives to contribute to the development of inclusive technology solutions that address the special needs of people with vision impairments.
